Search By Bug ID
#################

On the main menu there is a search box with a button that states "go to ID". 


Entering the id of a bug in this box and clicking the button will take you to the Edit Bug page for that specific bug. If the bug id entered is not valid or can't be found you will get a message stating that the bug was not found.
