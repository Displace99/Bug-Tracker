Deleting a Project

.. note::

    Creating a project can only be done by a system administrator. 

****************
Delete a project
****************
To delete a project, click the **admin** link on the main menu, then click **Projects**, and then select the **delete** link next to the project you want to have deleted. You will then be taken to a confirmation page to confirm the delete.

.. note::

    You can only delete a project if there are no bugs attached to it. If you don't want to dis-associate bugs from a project, edit the project to be 'inactive' instead.
