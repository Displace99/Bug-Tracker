Project Permissions
##################

.. note::

    Managing a project's permissions can only be done by a system administrator. 


There are two ways to manage user permissions for projects. The first is at the project level, and the second is at the user level. 

****************
Managing Permissions By Project
****************
The easiest way to manage permissions is by going into the specific project. 

Click the **admin** link on the main menu, then click **Projects**. From here you can either select the **permissions** link for the specific project, or you can click the **edit** then the **per user permissions** link. Both of these will take you to the same screen.

From here you will see all available users in the entire application.  Pick the permission level you would like each user to have for the specific project and click the **Update** button. 

.. note::

    This page lists all of the users in the entire system and goes through each of them to update. This can cause significant performance issues if you have a large amount of users. 


****************
Managing Permissions By User
****************
The other way to manage permissions is per user. 

Click the **admin** link on the main menu, then click **Users**. From here click the **edit** link, then **permissions**. This will take you to the following page.

Selecting the "Force user to add new bugs to this project" drop down will cause any bugs to be added to only that project. This is useful if you want someone that has View access to also be able to add new bugs, but not do anything else. 

In the Project table, you will see a list of projects and the permission level this user has for each project. You can change the permission level for each project needed. To save your changes press the **Update** button.
