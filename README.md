# Bug Tracker

As time moves forward, we have to continue to keep our applications up to date with the current technology and frameworks. Sometimes that doesn't happen. 

Bug Tracker is a project to update BugTracker.NET, which was originally created back in 2000, by Corey Trager. Even after all of those years, it's still being used, and this project is to bring it up to date using the most current .NET Framework.
