As time moves forward, we have to continue to keep our applications up to date with the current technology and frameworks. Sometimes that doesn't happen. 

Bug Tracker is a project to update BugTracker.NET, which was originally created back in 2000, by Corey Trager. Even after all of those years, it's still being used, and this project is to bring it up to date using the most current .NET Framework.

Although at this point we could get more "bang for the buck" if we just re-wrote it from the group up in .Net Core, that may not always be possible in the world. This project is to go through getting it from where it is to where we want it without a fresh rewrite.
